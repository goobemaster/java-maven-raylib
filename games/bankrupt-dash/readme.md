Debian/Ubuntu

````
sudo apt-get install default-jdk maven
````

## Package and Test

On Linux simply run the "package.sh" script.

On Windows simply run the "package.bat" script (untested).

The resulting jar will be executable and include all dependencies (so called "fat-jar").

````
java -jar kodenkel-scorched.jar
````
